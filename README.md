A modern, type-safe CLI for the [WHOOP API v2](https://developer.whoop.com/api). Perfect for:
- 🏃 Athletes tracking their recovery and strain
- 🤖 AI agents and LLMs needing structured health data
- 📊 Developers building health integrations
- 🔬 Researchers analyzing fitness metrics

## Features

- ✅ **Official WHOOP API v2** — OAuth2, not unofficial scraping
- ✅ **JSON-first output** — Perfect for piping and LLM consumption
- ✅ **Human-readable mode** — `--pretty` for terminal use
- ✅ **Encrypted token storage** — AES-256 at rest
- ✅ **Auto token refresh** — Seamless authentication
- ✅ **Type-safe** — Full TypeScript with strict mode
- ✅ **Well-tested** — 80%+ coverage requirement
- ✅ **Agent-friendly** — Includes SKILL.md for AI assistants

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g whoop-cli
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a WHOOP Developer App

1. Go to [developer.whoop.com](https://developer.whoop.com)
2. Create a new application
3. Set redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/callback`
4. Note your Client ID and Client Secret

### 2. Configure

```bash
export WHOOP_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
```

Or create a `.env` file in your working directory.

### 3. Authenticate

```bash
whoop auth login
```

This opens your browser for OAuth. Tokens are stored encrypted in `~/.whoop-cli/`.

### 4. Fetch Data

```bash
# Quick summary
whoop summary
# Output: Recovery: 72% | HRV: 45ms | Sleep: 85% | Strain: 8.2

# Today's recovery
whoop recovery

# Sleep data (JSON)
whoop sleep

# All data, human-readable
whoop --pretty

# Specific date
whoop --date 2026-01-10 --recovery --sleep
```

## For AI Agents

This CLI is designed to work seamlessly with AI agents. Include the bundled `SKILL.md` in your agent's context:

```bash
cat $(npm root -g)/whoop-cli/SKILL.md
```

The SKILL.md provides:
- Command reference
- Output schemas
- Common usage patterns
- Error handling guidance

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `WHOOP_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | OAuth client ID |
| `WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | OAuth client secret |
| `WHOOP_REDIRECT_URI` | No | Callback URL (default: `http://localhost:3000/callback`) |
| `WHOOP_TOKEN_PATH` | No | Token storage location (default: `~/.whoop-cli/`) |

## Security

- Tokens are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- Encryption key derived from machine-specific identifiers
- Tokens auto-refresh; you rarely need to re-authenticate
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details

## Privacy

This application accesses WHOOP health data via the official WHOOP API v2.

**Data Collection & Storage:**
- Health data (sleep, recovery, workouts, cycles) is fetched only when you run commands
- OAuth tokens are stored locally in `~/.whoop-cli/`, encrypted with AES-256
- No data is transmitted to any third-party servers
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry is implemented

**Data Usage:**
- Data is displayed locally or output as JSON for your own use
- You control what you do with the output (pipe to files, other tools, etc.)
- When used with AI agents, data is processed according to your agent's privacy policy

**Your Rights:**
- Revoke access anytime at [WHOOP App Settings](https://app.whoop.com/settings)
- Delete local tokens with `whoop auth logout`
- All data remains under your control
